//Just like you can add methods to your own constructor, you can also add methods and properties to built in classes in JavaScript like Arrays and Objects.

//Add a reverse method to the String 'class' so that every instance of String can call reverse and reverse itself.

  //code here
  String.prototype.reverse = function() {
    var o = '';
    for(var i = this.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
      o += this[i];
    }
    return o;
  }
